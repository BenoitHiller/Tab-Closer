Tab-Closer for google chrome
============================

This is a simple extension for google chrome that lets you close a bunch of similar tabs at once. I mainly use it when I have 50 tabs open to close all the google search tabs. There are usually enough of them that you are able to see the favicons again after running it. I hope you can think of something cooler to do with it.

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the extensions menu and make sure the developer mode box is clicked
3. Load the folder using the "load unpacked extension" button.

Usage
-----

Check out the options page for info about setting up the matchers, then complain to me about features you think it needs.
